## About Us üéÄ

We are a group of indie devs turned pseudo founders, driven by a passion for privacy, security, and decentralized technologies. Our mission is to create innovative solutions that empower users with secure and private digital tools.

## Our Projects ü™Ñ

- **FLuFHE**: A system for privacy-preserving federated learning using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This allows multiple parties to train AI models without sharing data, ensuring data privacy during computation. It's particularly useful in industries like healthcare.

- **fhe-vault**: A secure, decentralized vault protected by FHE and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). It provides a high standard of data protection for users. Note: This project is in its early stages, and we're looking for contributors to help develop it.

- **Lattice AI**: Our latest project, a decentralized AI inference network. It allows users to interact with AI models hosted on a distributed network of nodes, ensuring transparency, reliability, and tokenized economics. Stay tuned for more updates!
